
OSI Reference Model :

Layering : layering means decomposing the bigger problems into small manageable
           problems. It is done for easing the troubleshooting process.

The purpose of the OSI reference model is to ensure smooth network communication 
between two different OS in different nodes.

The Layers in OSI Reference model are :

1. Physical layer
2. Datalink layer.
3. Network layer
4. Transport layer
5. Session layer
6. Presentation Layer.
7. Application Layer.


The shortcut for remembering the OSI Reference model :

Please  - Physical layer
do - Datalink Layer
not - Network Layer
throw - Transport Layer
sausage - Session Layer
pizza - Presentation Layer
away - Application Layer

The Conversion of the data in the encrypted form to prevent from attackers, is the
job of the Application to Transport layer. The data can be accessed from Network,
Datalink and Physical Layer. When the data transverses from Intermediary nodes,its in
the encrypted format, but when it reaches the receiver, its again in the original
decrypted format.

Structure of OSI :

Node -->-- router -->-- application -->-- router -->-- physical -->-- Node
                        to physical                  to application

Where application being the most targetted and Physical meaning the most secure 
from attackers.
