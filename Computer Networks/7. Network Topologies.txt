
4. Mesh Topology :

- Nodes are connected to each other directly. No limitations.
- Scalabe and Fault tolerant.
- Peer to Peer architecture.
- All nodes have equal access to each other.
- Secure - since nodes carry data to other nodes directly.

Advantages :

- Reliable and secure.
- scalable and fault tolerant.

Disadvantages :

- Issues with broadcasting, since all nodes will broadcast and will cause data redudancy.
- Expensive due to the use of links connected to each node.
- Impractical for large number of networks.



5. Hybrid Topology : 

The combination of two or more topologies connected to each other is called as Hybrid Topology.
