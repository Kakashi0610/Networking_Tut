
Switching is used for selecting the best route for the data transmission 
of end device when there are multiple devices.

It is often done in One to One Connection.

Various typs of switching are :


1. Circuit Switching
2. Message Switching
3. Packet Switching


1. Circuit Switching : 

- Dedicated path established between sender and receiver.
- Before data transfer, a connection will be established first.
 
Threephases of Circuit Switching :

1. Connection establishment
2. Data transfer.
3. Connection ending / Disconnection.

Example : 

1. Connection Establishment : Person dials the telephone number to call.
2. Data transfer : Communication between the data sender and receiver via
                   phone call.
3. Disconnection : Ending the call.


2. Message Switching :

- Store aand forward mechanism.
- Each intermediary node store and forward mechanism until it reaches the 
  receiver.
- Not used for realtime operations like Call, video call, video streaming.

SAF = store and forward

Sender     SAF         SAF             SAF                 SAF               SAF
Node -->--Switch -->--Router -->-- Internet Cloud -->-- Webserver -->-- chat enviornment


3.Packet Switching :

- The internet uses the packet Switching technique for data transfer.
- The message is divided into smaller segments called as "Packets".
- These packets are individually sent via data transfer connection to end 
  devices. 
- Each data packet has sender and receiver IP address.
- It also includes the serial number according to the sequence of data.
  This ensures the data packets are sent in order and missing packets can
  can also be recognized and traced.
- There are 2 approaches in Packet Switching :

a. Datagram Packet Switching Approach.
b. Virtual Circuit Packet Switching Approach.

a. Datagram Packet Switching Approach :

- It is also known as Connectionless Switching.
- Each message is broken into smaller packet known as Datagrams.
- These datagrams consists of destination address of the receiver.
- The indermediary nodes uses this info to transfer the data via 
  different routes.
- Each node uses a different path than previous node to the receiver. Due 
  to this, the datagrams might be sent rearranged and sent to the receiver.
  But the receiver arranges itin sent order and passes to the End node.  


b. Virtual Circuit Packet Switching Approach :

- It is also known as Circuit-Oriented Switching.
- Here the route is set via using the Intermediary nodes to packets transfer.
- Data is sent via same route from the sender to the destination.
