
The layers in the OSI Reference model and services provided are :

1. Application layer : FTMA, Global Access, Mail Services.

2. Presentation layer : Translation, Encryption, Compression.

3. Session layer : Dialog control, Synchronization.

4. Transport Layer : Port Addressing, Segmentation and Reassembly, Connection Control, Flow Control,Error Control.

5. Network layer : Logical Addressing and routing.

6. Datalink layer : Framing, Physical Addressing, Flow Control, Error Control, Access Control.

7. Physical layer : Physical Topology and Transmission medium, Physical Characteristics of medium, Data Route, Representation of bits, Line Configuration.


The workimg of OSI Reference Model :

- The sender and the receiver are connected via a transission medium with numerous Intermediary devices.
- The data generated by the Application Layer is D7. In this, the application layer adds a Header H7 and passes it to the Presentation Layer.
- In the Presentation layer the data is Translated, Encrypted or Compressed and passed on tho the D5 layer-Session Layer.
- The Session Layer synchronizes the data transfer and data fetching rate to prevent Error Control.
- It is then forwarded to the Network Layer. In Network Layer, the port source address and destination address is added along with segmentation and Reassembly.
- The next Layer, Data Link layer then adds the MAC Address with the following data an dframing of data is done.
- The last layer comprises of adding the IP address with the data that is converted into 0's and 1's and checking all the physical characteristics of the Network 
  Communication as well as Topology. 
- The data is placed on the transmedium by the data link layer and is forwarded to the receiptants Network node.
- It is sent as the form of 0's and 1's and then procesed via all the layers from Physical layer to Application layer.
