
The layers in the OSI Reference model are :
1. Application Layer
2. Presentation Layer
3. Session layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Network layer
6. Data Link Layer
7. Physical Layer


1. Application Layer : 

- Used as an app or an platform by which the process of data transfer is being initiated.

The services provided by Application layer are : 

1. File Transfer and Access Method (FTAM) : Here the user can send/receive a file from the endpoint node. It also enables the first node to 
                                            access the data present in the second node.
2. Mail services : The transfer of data via mailing applications is done by the Application Layer.
3. Directory Services : The ability to access the data worldwide via any communication medium is known as Directory services.

Presentation Layer : The meaning and the representation of the data that is being transfered is checked by the Presentation layer. The 
semantics(representation in bits)and the syntax(consists of what the bits contain) part is done by Presentation Layer.

The presentation layers services are as follows : 
1. Translation : The data is translated to the language which is readable and understandable to the end user.
2. Encryption: It is used to convert the data in an  unknown format which can be only accessed by the sender and receiver, saving the data 
from the attackers.
Compression : The task of reducing the unnecessary data bytes from the transmitted data is known as Compression. Compression is mainly done 
in the data which is present in multi-media format.


Session Layer : The session layer is used to establish, Maintain and Synchronize the interaction between two communication devices.

The roles of the Session layer are : 
1. Dialogue control : the dialogue control ensures the communication between two networks is done in half duplex (one way communication) or Full 
duolex (two way communication)
2. Synchronization
